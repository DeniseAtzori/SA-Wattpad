Basically this is a very silly test.
You are testing the Syuzhet package using short, inane sentences.
I am actually very happy today.
I have finally finished writing this package.
Tomorrow I will be very sad.
I won't have anything left to do.
I might get angry and decide to do something horrible.
I might destroy the entire package and start from scratch.
Then again, I might find it satisfying to have completed my first R package.
Honestly this use of the Fourier transformation is really quite elegant.
You might even say it's beautiful!"
